## 1. Non-Partisan Stance
NishadRaj OS is and shall remain a strictly non-partisan digital utility.
- **Universal Access**: The OS and its tools are available to all who comply with the technical and ethical code of conduct, regardless of their political or religious beliefs.
- **No Political Endorsement**: The project, its governance council, and its official brand shall never endorse any political party, candidate, or sectarian movement.
- **Neutral Infrastructure**: We build tools, not agendas. The platform's goal is technical and cultural resilience, not political influence.

## 2. Academic Integrity Priority
We prioritize technical excellence and scholarly objectivity over popular or corporate trends.
- **Evidence-Based Design**: Architectural decisions must be backed by technical logic and academic research.
- **Independent Peer Review**: Encouraging external scholars to audit and critique our systems without fear of repercussion.
- **Knowledge Sovereignty**: Ensuring that the project's educational and research outputs remain accessible and untainted by commercial or political bias.

## 3. No Political Campaigning
NishadRaj-owned resources and digital channels are prohibited from being used for political campaigning.
- **Zero Tolerance**: Use of the official "Sovereign Nodes" for electioneering, partisan fundraising, or political lobbying is strictly forbidden.
- **Brand Protection**: Any unauthorized use of the NishadRaj trademark in a political context will be met with immediate legal action and technical isolation of the offending node.

## 4. No Misuse for Propaganda
The platform's tools shall never be weaponized for disinformation or propaganda.
- **Neutrality Enforcement Layer**: AI-driven agents are authorized to flag and block content that clearly violates the non-partisan and non-harm (Ahimsa) mandates.
- **Informational Integrity**: We prioritize the preservation of historical facts and verifiable data over ideological narratives.
- **Discourse Quality**: Promoting a technical and academic standard of discourse that discourages divisive or exclusionary rhetoric.
