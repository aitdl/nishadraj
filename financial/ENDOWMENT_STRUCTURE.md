## 1. Long-term Reserve Fund Model
The NishadRaj Endowment is designed to ensure the eternal continuity of the OS, independent of short-term economic fluctuations.
- **Sovereign Capital**: A pool of assets managed specifically to generate the yield required for core system maintenance.
- **Compounding Mandate**: Re-investing a percentage of yield to combat inflation and grow the project's foundational strength.
- **Ethical Investment Policy**: Funds are placed only in transparent, non-conflicting, and ethically aligned instruments.

## 2. Governance-Controlled Disbursement
Access to endowment funds is strictly gated.
- **Core Maintenance Only**: Disbursements are typically restricted to "Kernel-Level" maintenance, security emergency response, and core educational infrastructure.
- **Multi-Signature Approval**: Any withdrawal requires the cryptographic signature of the Chief Architect and a majority of the Financial Council.
- **Emergency Release Protocol**: In the event of a total cessation of external funding, the endowment switches to a "Minimal Survival" disbursement mode to keep the sovereign nodes alive.

## 3. Advisory Oversight
Independent verification of fiscal health.
- **Financial Advisory Board**: A separate council of institutional and scholarly partners who oversee the fund's management.
- **No Private Enrichment**: The endowment is a public utility asset; it belongs to the mission of NishadRaj OS and AITDL, not to individuals.
- **Annual Solvency Report**: A public declaration of the fund's status, yield, and disbursement history.

## 4. Public Transparency Metrics
Transparency as a trust-builder.
- **Total Asset Value (TAV)**: Real-time (or near real-time) visibility into the endowment's size.
- **Yield Distribution**: Tracking how much the endowment contributes to the annual operating budget.
- **Disbursement Impact**: Linking endowment spending to successful technical and cultural milestones.
