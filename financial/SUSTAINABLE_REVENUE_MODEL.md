## 1. Diversified Revenue Streams
NishadRaj OS maintains its independence through a "Multi-Stream Funding" approach, ensuring no single benefactor can exert undue influence.
1. **Voluntary Donations**: Community-driven micro-funding from supporters of digital sovereignty.
2. **Research Grants**: Funding from academic institutions and foundations for specific technical or philosophical research milestones.
3. **Institutional Partnerships**: Annual membership or coordination fees from regional nodes and institutional partners.
4. **Educational Programs**: Fees from specialized training, certification, and sovereignty-focused developer workshops.
5. **Fellowship Sponsorship**: Corporate or institutional grants specifically designated for the Research Fellow Program.
6. **Digital Archive Access Programs**: Managed access for scholars and researchers to specialized cultural registries (non-commercial).
7. **Advisory & Consulting Services**: The "Governance Export Model"â€”providing expert guidance to other organizations on deploying governed, autonomous infrastructures.

## 2. Financial Discipline & Transparency
We treat transparency as a core technical requirement.
- **Mandatory Financial Disclosure**: Real-time reporting of all incoming grants and donations on the Transparency Dashboard.
- **Annual Audit Publication**: Every fiscal year concludes with a comprehensive, third-party audit of all AITDL-managed resources.
- **Risk-Based Budgeting**: All expenditures must be tied to specific, governance-approved tasks in the `task_registry.json`.

## 3. Reserve & Sustainability
Building for civilizational continuity.
- **3-Year Sustainability Buffer**: Our target is to maintain liquid reserves sufficient to cover three years of core technical operations.
- **Endowment Reserve Strategy**: A portion of all revenue is channeled into a long-term endowment fund to ensure project survival during economic downturns.
- **Advisory Oversight**: The Financial Council manages all disbursement, subject to the veto power of the Chief Architect on any mission-altering fiscal decisions.
