# Brand Positioning: NishadRaj OS

## Vision Statement
To establish the world's first **Sovereign Open Source** operating system governed by deterministic AI laws, ensuring that automation remains ethical, transparent, and under human-defined guardianship.

## Sovereign Open Source Philosophy
NishadRaj OS is more than just open code; it is an **enforced environment**. Unlike traditional open source which relies on social norms, NishadRaj OS uses cryptographic signatures and a multi-agent hierarchy to ensure that its core principles and protective governance cannot be bypassed.

## Governance Promise
We promise a system where every action is audited, every change is signed, and every operation follows a transparent, human-authorized plan.

## Community Participation Model
We welcome builders, planners, and auditors. Our community is stratified by governance roles, allowing for rapid innovation within a safe, controlled framework.
