# Institutional Declaration — NishadRaj OS

## Public Statement of Digital Sovereignty
We, the developers and community of NishadRaj OS, declare our commitment to a sovereign digital future. NishadRaj OS is more than an operating system; it is a declaration of independence from centralized technological control.

## Open Source Philosophy
Our code is public, our governance is deterministic, and our mission is transparent. We operate under a controlled open-source model that prevents the extraction of digital value without community benefit.

## Legal Ownership Structure
NishadRaj OS is governed by a **Sovereign Trust/Foundation** structure (under establishment) led by Jawahar R Mallah. This structure ensure that the project's assets and intellectual property serve the public good.

## Community Invitation
We invite developers, researchers, and cultural enthusiasts to join us in building a robust, ethical, and culturally aware technological ecosystem.

## Transparency Promise
Every decision that affects the core architecture of NishadRaj OS will be logged, signed, and made available for public audit. We believe that trust is earned through verifiable integrity.
