## 1. Organization Introduction
NishadRaj OS is an institutional-grade, sovereign open-source ecosystem designed to provide a secure and autonomous foundation for digital civilization. We focus on creating computing environments that are independent of centralized corporate or political control, governed by deterministic code and institutional integrity.

## 2. Mission Statement
To establish a sovereign, autonomous, and ethically governed open-source ecosystem that empowers individuals and communities through decentralized technology and open knowledge.

## 3. Governance-First Development Philosophy
In NishadRaj OS, **Code is Law, but Governance is the Foundation.** Every architectural decision and code change is filtered through a rigid governance layer that ensures alignment with our founding charter. We prioritize long-term stability and structural integrity over rapid, ungoverned expansion.

## 4. Open Source (Controlled) Explanation
We operate under a "Controlled Open Source" model. While the source code is transparent and available under the AGPL-3.0 license, the evolution of the official "Sovereign Branch" is strictly regulated. This ensures that the system cannot be compromised by unauthorized or malicious modifications, maintaining the trust of its users.

## 5. Security & Signature Model
Security is not an afterthought; it is baked into the OS kernel. 
- **Deterministic Execution**: Only verified and signed code can run on the system.
- **Cryptographic Sovereignty**: Every core component is cryptographically signed, ensuring that the identity and integrity of the system are always verifiable.
- **Auditability**: All system logs and governance actions are immutable and publicly accessible for audit.

## 6. Contribution Process
We welcome contributions from those who align with our mission. However, all contributions must undergo:
1. **Formal Proposal**: Aligning with the current roadmap.
2. **Review**: Rigorous inspection by the Technical and Governance Councils.
3. **Automated Validation**: Passing all `validator_agent` integrity and safety checks.
4. **Signature**: Final approval and cryptographic signing by the Authorized Signatory.

## 7. Code of Conduct Reference
All participants are expected to adhere to our [Policy Framework](file:///d:/IMP/GitHub/nishadraj/institutional/POLICY_FRAMEWORK.md), which mandates professional respect, technical excellence, and inclusivity.

## 8. Transparency Commitment
Radical transparency is our standard. Our [Transparency Dashboard](file:///d:/IMP/GitHub/nishadraj/docs/TRANSPARENCY_DASHBOARD_SPEC.md) (in development) will provide real-time visibility into governance decisions, hash registries, and system health.

## 9. Roadmap Snapshot
- **Phase 1: Institutional Foundation** â€” Establishing legal and governance frameworks (Current).
- **Phase 2: Core Kernel Hardening** â€” Implementing deterministic execution and signature models.
- **Phase 3: Sovereign Cloud Infrastructure** â€” Deploying autonomous hosting nodes.
- **Phase 4: Community Empowerment** â€” Launching local advocacy chapters and developer toolkits.
