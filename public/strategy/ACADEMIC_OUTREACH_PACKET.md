## 3. Governance Assurance Summary
For academic partners, trust in the foundation is paramount. This summary outlines our integrity model:
- **Code as Law**: All system operations are governed by deterministic, verifiable rules.
- **Radical Transparency**: Publicly accessible logs for all governance actions and financial grants.
- **Chief Architect Veto**: A life-term commitment from founder Jawahar R Mallah to prevent unauthorized mission-drift.
- **Non-Political Neutrality**: A strict mandate ensuring the system is never used for partisan or ideological propaganda.

## 4. Open Source Compliance Explanation
NishadRaj OS operates under the AGPL-3.0 license with Additional Governance Protection Terms.
- **Transparency**: Scholars have full visibility into the source code for deep audits and research.
- **Reciprocity**: Improvements to the core system must be shared back with the community, ensuring collective progress.
- **Sovereignty Protection**: Unlike standard open source, our governance terms prevent the "hostile forking" that often leads to fragmentation and security decay in critical infrastructure projects.
