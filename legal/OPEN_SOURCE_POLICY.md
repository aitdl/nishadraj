# Open Source Policy: NishadRaj OS

NishadRaj OS operates under a **Controlled Open Source** model. While the code is open under AGPL-3.0, its execution and evolution are strictly governed.

## Policy Rules

1. **Contribution Workflow**: All contributions must be submitted via Pull Requests. No direct commits to the main branch are permitted.
2. **Rigid Review**: Every contribution is subject to a mandatory code review by the Governance Authority.
3. **Automated Validation**: The `preflight_check()` within the `validator_agent.py` is an absolute gate. Any contribution failing this check will be automatically rejected.
4. **Signature Verification**: All core components must be cryptographically signed. Unauthorized modifications that break signatures will prevent the system from starting.
5. **Enforcement Perseverance**: Forked versions of NishadRaj OS are legally and technically required to maintain the governance layer's enforcement capabilities.
